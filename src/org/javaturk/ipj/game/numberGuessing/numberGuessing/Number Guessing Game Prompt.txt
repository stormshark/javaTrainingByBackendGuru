I am a trainer who teaches Java to new comers and I want you to develop a game for me.

This is a number guessing game played between the computer and a person, who is the player.
The player holds a 4-digit number in her memory and the computer tries to find
it by giving several guesses.

The number can't have any repeating digit and can't start
with 0. Each try that the program that you develop makes is a 4-digit number and the player evaluates
the guess and return an answer with some description or feedback. The feedback has + (plus) for
each digit in correct place and - (minus) for each digit in wrong place.
For example the player holds 5174 and the computer's guess is 1234 the the answer would
be +1 and -1. Second guess might be 6890 and then the answer would be 0.
Whenever the answer is +4 then it means the guess is correct which means the computer
guesses the number correctly and the game finishes.

Can you give me the code for this game in Java? Please use a basic array to store numbers, don't use List or any other
collection of Java. This code will be used in a training to teach Java to my students. So make the code clean.
